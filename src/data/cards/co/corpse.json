	"wordOrigin": "Middle English (denoting the living body of a person or animal): alteration of archaic corse by association with Latin corpus, a change which also took place in French (Old French cors becoming corps). The p was originally silent, as in French; the final e was rare before the 19th cent., but now distinguishes corpse from corps."
