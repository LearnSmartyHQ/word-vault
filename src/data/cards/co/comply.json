	"wordOrigin": "late 16th cent.: from Italian complire, Catalan complir, Spanish cumplir, from Latin complere ‘fill up, fulfil’, from com- (expressing intensive force) + plere ‘fill’. The original sense was ‘fulfil, accomplish’, later ‘fulfil the requirements of courtesy’, hence ‘to be agreeable, to oblige ’or‘ obey’. Compare with compliment."
