	"wordOrigin": "Middle English: from Old French conte, from Latin comitatus, from comes, comit- ‘companion, overseer, attendant’ (in late Latin ‘person holding a state office’), from com- ‘together with’ + it- ‘gone’ (from the verb ire ‘go’). The word seems first to have denoted a periodical meeting held to transact business in the area (the shire)."
