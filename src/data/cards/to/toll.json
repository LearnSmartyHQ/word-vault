	"wordOrigin": "noun senses 1 to 2 and noun sense 4 Old English (denoting a charge, tax, or duty), from medieval Latin toloneum, alteration of late Latin teloneum, from Greek telōnion ‘toll house’, from telos ‘tax’. Sense (2) (late 19th cent.) arose from the notion of paying a toll or tribute in human lives (to an adversary or to death). noun sense 3 late Middle English: probably a special use of dialect toll ‘drag, pull’."
