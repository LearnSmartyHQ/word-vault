  "wordOrigin": "late Middle English (in the sense ‘article of furniture, equipment, or dress’): partly from medieval Latin implementa (plural), partly from late Latin implementum ‘filling up, fulfilment’, both from Latin implere ‘fill up’ (later ‘employ’), from in- ‘in’ + Latin plere ‘fill’. The verb dates from the early 18th cent."
