	"wordOrigin": "late Middle English (as a noun denoting the action of looking towards a distant object): from Latin prospectus ‘view’, from prospicere ‘look forward’, from pro- ‘forward’ + specere ‘to look’. Early use, referring to a view of landscape, gave rise to the meaning ‘mental picture’ (mid 16th cent.), which led to the meaning ‘anticipated event’."
