  "wordOrigin": "late Middle English: via Old French and Latin from Greek oikonomikos, from oikonomia ‘household management’, based on oikos ‘house’ + nemein ‘manage’. Originally a noun, the word denoted household management or a person skilled in this, hence the early sense of the adjective (late 16th cent.) ‘relating to household management’. Modern senses date from the mid 19th cent."
