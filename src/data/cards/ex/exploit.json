	"wordOrigin": "Middle English: from Old French esploit (noun), based on Latin explicare ‘unfold’, from ex- ‘out’ + plicare ‘to fold’. The early notion of ‘success, progress’ gave rise to the sense ‘attempt to capture’, ‘military expedition’, hence the current sense of the noun. Verb senses (mid 19th cent.) are from modern French exploiter."
