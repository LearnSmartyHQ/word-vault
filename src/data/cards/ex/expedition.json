  "wordOrigin": "late Middle English: via Old French from Latin expeditio(n-), from expedire ‘extricate’, from ex- ‘out’ + pes, ped- ‘foot’. Early senses included ‘prompt supply of something’ and ‘setting out with aggressive intent’. The notions of ‘speed’ and ‘purpose’ are retained in current senses. Sense (1) dates from the late 16th cent."
