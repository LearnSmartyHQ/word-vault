	"wordOrigin": "mid 16th cent. (in the sense ‘reject scornfully’): from Latin explodere ‘drive out by clapping, hiss off the stage’, from ex- ‘out’ + plaudere ‘to clap’. Sense (7) is derived from the original sense of the word. Sense (1) (late 18th cent.) evolved via an old sense ‘expel with violence and sudden noise’, perhaps influenced by obsolete displode ‘burst with a noise’."
