	"wordOrigin": "early 16th cent.: from Latin locat- ‘placed’, from the verb locare, from locus ‘place’. The original sense was as a legal term meaning ‘let out on hire’, later (late 16th cent.) ‘assign to a particular place’, then (particularly in North American usage) ‘establish in a place’. The sense ‘discover the exact position of’ dates from the late 19th cent."
