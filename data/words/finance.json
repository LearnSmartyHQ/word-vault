  "wordOrigin": "late Middle English: from Old French, from finer ‘make an end, settle a debt’, from fin ‘end’, from Latin finis ‘end’ (in medieval Latin denoting a sum paid on settling a lawsuit). The original sense was ‘payment of a debt, compensation, or ransom’; later ‘taxation, revenue’. Current senses date from the 18th cent., and reflect sense development in French."
