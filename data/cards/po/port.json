  "wordOrigin": "noun senses 1 to 2 Old English, from Latin portus ‘haven, harbour’, reinforced in Middle English by Old French. noun senses 3 to 4 shortened form of Oporto, a major port in Portugal from which the wine is shipped. noun sense 5 mid 16th cent.: probably originally the side containing an entry port or facing the port (quayside) for loading. noun sense 6 Old English (in the sense ‘gateway’), from Latin porta ‘gate’; reinforced in Middle English by Old French porte. The later sense ‘opening in the side of a ship’ led to the general sense ‘opening’."
