  "wordOrigin": "late Middle English: from Latin incorrectus, from in- ‘not’ + correctus ‘made straight, amended’ (from the verb corrigere, from cor- ‘together’ + regere ‘guide’). Originally in the general sense ‘uncorrected’, the word was later applied specifically to a book containing many errors because it had not been corrected for the press; hence sense (2) (late 17th cent.)."
