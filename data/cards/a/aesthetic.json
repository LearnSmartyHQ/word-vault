  "wordOrigin": "late 18th cent. (in the sense ‘relating to perception by the senses’): from Greek aisthētikos, from aisthēta ‘perceptible things’, from aisthesthai ‘perceive’. The sense ‘concerned with beauty’ was first used in German in the mid 18th cent. and adopted into English in the early 19th cent., but its use was controversial until much later in the century."
