  "wordOrigin": "Middle English (in senses (1-3) of noun): from Old French air, from Latin aer, from Greek aēr, denoting the gas. Senses 4 and 6 () of the noun are from French air, probably from Old French aire ‘site, disposition’, from Latin ager, agr- ‘field’ (influenced by senses 1-3). Sense (5) of the noun comes from Italian aria, from Latin aer ‘air’."
