  "wordOrigin": "Middle English (as a verb in the senses ‘set upright’ and ‘guide, direct’, hence ‘write directions for delivery on’ and ‘direct spoken words to’): from Old French, based on Latin ad- ‘towards’ + directus past participle of dirigere, from di- ‘distinctly’ or de- ‘down’ + regere ‘put straight’. The noun is of mid 16th-cent. origin in the sense ‘act of approaching or speaking to somebody’."
