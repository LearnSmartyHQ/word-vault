  "wordOrigin": "Middle English (as a noun): from Old French curer (verb), cure (noun), both from Latin curare ‘take care of’, from cura ‘care’. The original noun senses were ‘care, concern, responsibility’, in particular spiritual care. In late Middle English the senses ‘medical care’ and ‘successful medical treatment’ arose, and hence ‘remedy’."
