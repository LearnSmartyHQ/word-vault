  "wordOrigin": "Middle English: from Old French ferme, from medieval Latin firma ‘fixed payment’, from Latin firmare ‘fix, settle’ (in medieval Latin ‘contract for’), from firmus ‘constant, firm’; compare with firm (noun). The noun originally denoted a fixed annual amount payable as rent or tax; which later gave rise to ‘to subcontract’ (farm somebody/​something out to somebody. ). The noun came to denote ‘a lease’, and, in the early 16th cent., ‘land leased for farming’."
