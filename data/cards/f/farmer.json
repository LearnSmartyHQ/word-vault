  "wordOrigin": "late Middle English: from Old French fermier, from medieval Latin firmarius, firmator, from firma ‘fixed payment’, from Latin firmare ‘fix, settle’ (in medieval Latin ‘contract for’), from firmus ‘constant, firm’. The current sense originally denoted ‘a bailiff’ or ‘steward who farmed land on the owner's behalf’, or ‘a tenant farmer’."
