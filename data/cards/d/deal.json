  "wordOrigin": "verb Old English dǣlan ‘divide’, ‘participate’, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch deel and German Teil ‘part’ (noun), also to dole. The sense ‘divide’ gave rise to ‘distribute’, hence sense 1 of the verb and 'deal somebody/​something a blow'; the sense ‘participate’ gave rise to ‘have dealings with’, hence senses 2 of the verb and 'deal with'/'deal in'."
