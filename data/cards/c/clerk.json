  "wordOrigin": "Old English cleric, clerc (in the sense ‘ordained minister, literate person’), from ecclesiastical Latin clericus ‘clergyman’, from Greek klērikos ‘belonging to the Christian clergy’, from klēros ‘lot, heritage’ (Acts 1:26); reinforced by Old French clerc, from the same source. Sense (1) dates from the early 16th cent."
