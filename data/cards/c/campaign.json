  "wordOrigin": "early 17th cent. (denoting a large area of open country): from French campagne ‘open country’, via Italian from late Latin campania, from campus ‘level ground’, specifically applied to the Campus Martius in Rome, used for games, athletic practice, and military drill. The change in sense arose from an army's practice of “taking the field” (i.e. moving from a fortress or town to open country) at the onset of summer."
