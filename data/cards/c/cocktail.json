  "wordOrigin": "early 17th cent.: from cock + tail. The original use was as an adjective describing a creature with a tail like that of a cock, specifically a horse with a docked tail; hence (because hunters and coach-horses were generally docked) a racehorse which was not a thoroughbred, having a cock-tailed horse in its pedigree (early 19th cent.). Sense (1) (originally US, also early 19th cent.) is perhaps an analogy, from the idea of an impure spirit."
