  "wordOrigin": "mid 16th cent.: from French toilette ‘cloth, wrapper’, diminutive of toile ‘cloth, web’, from Latin tela ‘web’. The word originally denoted a cloth used as a wrapper for clothes; then (in the 17th cent.) a cloth cover for a dressing table, the articles used in dressing, and the process of dressing, later also of washing oneself (sense (4)). In the 19th cent. the word came to denote a dressing room, and, in the US, one with washing facilities; hence, a lavatory (early 20th cent.)."
