  "wordOrigin": "noun senses 1 to 2 late Middle English: from Old Norse typpi (noun), typpa (verb), typptr ‘tipped’; related to the noun top. noun senses 3 to 5 late Middle English: perhaps of Scandinavian origin, influenced later by tip in the sense ‘touch with a tip or point’. Current senses of the noun date from the mid 19th cent. noun senses 6 to 7 early 17th cent. (in the sense ‘give, hand, pass’): probably from tip ‘thin pointed end of something’."
