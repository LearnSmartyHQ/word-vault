  "wordOrigin": "late Middle English (in Aristotelian logic): from late Latin praedicamentum ‘something predicated’ (rendering Greek katēgoria ‘category’), from Latin praedicare, from prae ‘beforehand’ + dicare ‘make known’. From the sense ‘category’ arose the sense ‘state of being, condition’; hence ‘unpleasant situation’."
