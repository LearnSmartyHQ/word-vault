  "wordOrigin": "Middle English: from Old French baterie, from battre ‘to strike’, from Latin battuere. The original sense was ‘metal articles wrought by hammering’, later ‘a number of pieces of artillery used together’, which led to the meaning ‘a number of Leyden jars connected up so as to discharge simultaneously’ (mid 18th cent.), giving rise to sense (1). The more general meanings date from the late 19th cent."
