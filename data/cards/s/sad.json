  "wordOrigin": "Old English sæd ‘sated, weary’, also ‘weighty, dense’, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch zat and German satt, from an Indo-European root shared by Latin satis ‘enough’. The original meaning was replaced in Middle English by the senses ‘steadfast, firm’ and ‘serious, sober’, and later ‘sorrowful’."
