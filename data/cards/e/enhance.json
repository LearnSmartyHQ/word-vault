  "wordOrigin": "Middle English (formerly also as inhance): from Anglo-Norman French enhauncer, based on Latin in- (expressing intensive force) + altus ‘high’. The word originally meant ‘elevate’ (literally and figuratively), later ‘exaggerate, make appear greater’, also ‘raise the value or price of something’. Current senses date from the early 16th cent."
