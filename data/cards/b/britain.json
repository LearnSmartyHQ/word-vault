  "wordOrigin": "Old English Breoton, from Latin Brittones ‘Britons’, superseded in Middle English by forms from Old French Bretaigne (from Latin Brit(t)annia). It became a largely historical term until revived in the mid 16th cent., as the possible union of England and Scotland became a subject of political concern."
