# Oxford Learner's Word Lists

Our word lists are designed to help English language learners at any level focus on the most important words to learn in their area of study. Based on our extensive corpora (= collections of written and spoken texts) and aligned to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages ([CEFR](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/wordlists/cefr)), the word lists have been carefully researched and developed together with vocabulary experts, so that you know you can rely on them in your learning or teaching.
